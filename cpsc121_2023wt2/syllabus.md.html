Course Description
======================================================================================
An introduction to discrete mathematics through the lens of computer science. This course will bridge the gap between applied mathematics and computer science showing why the many names in computer science such as Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace and George Boole were first mathematicians. We will look at aspects of Boolean algebra, logic circuits, basic proof techniques, sequential circuits, sets theory, finite state machines, sequential instruction execution and the Von Neumann architecture.

Course Pre-requisite(s):
: - Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12

Course Co-requisite(s):
: - CPSC 110

Learning Outcomes
======================================================================================
  * Convert binary values such as unsigned integers, two's complement, and signed integers to decimal and vice-versa.
  * Convert unsigned integers from hexadecimal to binary and vice-versa.
  * Translate back and forth between simple natural language statements and propositional logic.
  * Evaluate the truth of propositional logic statements using truth tables.
  * Explore alternate forms of propositional logic statements by application of equivalence rules, especially in order to simplify complex statements or massage statements into a desired form.
  * Translate back and forth between propositional logic statements and circuits that assess the truth of those statements.
  * Build computational systems to solve real problems, using both propositional logic expressions and equivalent digital logic circuits.
  * Determine whether or not a propositional logic proof is valid, and explain why it is valid or invalid.
  * Explore the consequences of a set of propositional logic statements by application of equivalence and inference rules, especially in order to massage statements into a desired form.
  * Evaluate the truth of statements that include predicates applied to particular values.
  * Translate between statements in formal predicate logic notation and equivalent statements in closely matching informal language (i.e., informal statements with clear and explicitly stated quantifiers).
  * Build statements about the relationships between statements about sets and predicate logic.
  * Sketch the structure of a proof that uses the strategies:
   * constructive/non-constructive proofs of existence
   * generalizing from the generic particular
   * direct proof (antecedent assumption)
   * indirect proofs by contrapositive and contradiction
   * proof by cases
   * logical equivalences
   * rules of inference
   * universal modus ponens/tollens
  * Manipulate formulas in summation/product notation by adjusting their bounds, merging or splitting summations/products, and factoring out values.
  * Establish properties of self-referential structures using inductive proofs that naturally build on those self- references.
  * Critique formal inductive proofs to determine whether they are valid and where the error(s) lie if they are invalid.
  * Trace the operation of a DFA (deterministic finite-state automaton) represented as a diagram on an input, and indicate whether the DFA accepts or rejects the input.
  * Deduce the language accepted by a simple DFA after working through multiple example inputs.
  * Translate a DFA into a sequential circuit that implements the DFA.
  * Explain the difference between a DFA and a non-deterministic finite-state automaton (NFA).
  * Explain how and why each part of the resulting circuit works.
  * Specify the overall architecture of a (Von Neumann) stored program computer. An architecture that instantiates the principle that both program and data are bits (i.e., state) loaded and stored in (common) memory.
  * Trace execution of an instruction through a working computer in a logic simulator (currently logisim): the basic fetch-decode-execute instruction cycle and the data flow to/from the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the main memory and the Program Counter (PC).

Course Policies
======================================================================================
It is the responsibility of every student to read and understand the College Policies. The College Policies on Academic Honesty, Academic Standing, Academic Concession, Final Exam , Grading Practices, Student Conduct, Technology Usage, and more can be found here: [https://corpuschristi.ca/current-students/#Policies](https://corpuschristi.ca/current-students/#Policies)

In addition to the College Policies, this course also upholds the following policies and practices: 
* **Rule #1**: You must **own** your own work. You must be able to deeply understand and defend on your own submitted work (assignments, labs, worksheets, quizzes, exams), without needing to consult external material. For instance, at any time, the course instructor should be able to inquire you about your submitted work, and you should be able to give a satisfactory explanation. **The course instructor reserves the right to perform oral interviews or other spot checks to verify the originality of submitted student work, and significantly reduce your mark if your have violated this rule.** 
* **Rule #2**: You are encouraged to collaborate together with other students, and use learning resources available to you (textbooks, notes, large language models, asking experts). You must acknowledge all learning resources that you use. 
* **Rule #3**: No collaboration of any kind is permitted during the quizzes, midterms or during the final exam. 
* **Any violation of the rules listed above will result in a 0 on the work containing misconduct and will be reported, in writing, to the Academic Dean.**
* NB: these policies substantially may depart from the UBC Department of Computer Science’s Policy regarding collaboration on academic work, and in particular the CPSC 121 policies. It’s highly recommended you be aware of their policies, in case you want to transfer into that Department. 
 
Attendance:
* As per the college Final Exam policy, students who miss more than 25% of course lectures may be barred from writing the final exam.

Accomodations:
* Students with documented disabilities who may require accommodations must contact the [UBC Centre for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) as soon as possible. Please be aware of the deadlines during the term for requesting accomodation.

Assignments:
* It is encouraged that assignments are done in groups of two, though you may work alone if you choose. Assignments will be submitted on Canvas. For groups, only one submission should be made per group.
* **You must *typeset* your assignments on a computer. Handwritten solutions are not accepted.** You can use any software you choose (e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LaTeX). **Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor is highly recommended!** see their website for supporting documentation and tutorials (overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials). Here are some [helpful notes on LaTeX](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/maths220/2018/latex/) from a UBC MATH 220 instructor.
* **Figures of circuits must be done in CircuitVerse or software of at least equal quality, not by hand.**
* **Consult each assignment in detail for their specific instructions.**
* Not all parts of the assignment may be marked.
* We may have a peer review component to assignments [Canvas ComPAIR](https://compair.open.ubc.ca/faq/).

In-class Worksheets and Overall Participation:
* You **must pre-read** the assigned readings in the _Epp_ textbook before the lecture.
* Participation marks will be awarded in each lecture based on your active participation: questions asked, volunteering to work out a problem in front of the class. Note that you don't need to already lnow the answer, it is your engagement to learn the material actively that is awarded marks.
* Most/all classes will have an in-class worksheet that must be completed during the specified class time (not for take home work).

Quizzes and Labs:
* There will be no opportunity for extensions / make up quizzes and labs.
* The lowest quiz will be dropped (but not labs).
* If an officially excused absence is granted then the affected quizzes and labs typically be omitted from the final grade (i.e. you will not be penalized).

Late/Missing Assignments:
* A late assignment will be deducted 10% for every day the assignment is late. For instance, an assignment that is 2 days late and graded out of 100 points will be awarded a maximum of 80 points.
* If an officially excused absence is granted then the affected assignments may be omitted from the final grade (i.e. you will not be penalized).

Extensions on Assignments:
* As a general rule, extensions on assignments will almost never be granted. Instead, the lowest assignment will be dropped. Extensions on course work will only be granted due to illness or similar **extraordinary** circumstances. In such a case, a note signed by a physician stating the date and time of the visit to the doctor’s office may be required. 
* **Any late work cannot be accepted three weeks after the end of term for any reason.**

Missed Exams:
* Missing midterm exams due to an officially excused absense will either result in a make-up midterm exam, or omission from the mark.
* In the case of the final exam, as per existing policy, the student must get in touch with the instructor within 48 hours of the missed final.
