In order to test your submission:

1. Assemble your subbmiited zipped folder, and then download the testing files (`test.sh`,  and `test_*.py` testing files).

2. Ensure these all files are in a fresh directory. This can be done on repl.it through uploading.

3. Run `sh test.sh` in a terminal (command line). Helpful suggestions: you can use a Terminal.app in MacOS, a Terminal in an IDE, the Console in repl.it, or another terminal of your choosing. You will need to have installed the commands used in `test.sh`: `echo`, `basename`, `unzip`, etc.

4. Ensure you pass the tests.
