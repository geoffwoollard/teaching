Calendar Description
======================================================================================
This course offers fundamental program and computation structures. The course takes you through introductory programming skills exploring computation as a tool for information processing, simulation and modeling, and interacting with the world.

Course Description
======================================================================================
An introduction to computer programming made for students with very little or no programming knowledge. The fundamental concepts and terminology of computing science will be taught so that the students can acquire elementary skills for programming in Python. This knowledge can be applied in diverse fields and applications of computing science.

Course Pre-requisite(s):
: - Grade 12 Math

Learning Outcomes
======================================================================================
1. Describe fundamental concepts pertaining to computing science:
  * Computer science
  * Problem solving
  * Algorithms
  * Decomposition
  * Abstraction
  * Computer program
  * Programming language
  * History of computers/computation
  
2. Describe and apply fundamental concepts and terminology of Python:
  * Variables, types, expressions, operators, statements, parameters
  * Conditions and execution flow
  * Calling functions
  * Variable scope:
    * Rules of scope for local variables in functions
    * Rules for accessing global variables from within a function

3. Create (design), analyze, and explain the behaviour of simple algorithms:
  * Express algorithms in pseudocode and flowchart diagrams
  * Solve problems by designing simple algorithms, e.g., basic calculations, searching in strings and lists, counting, calculating running sums and products
  * Create while loops with compound conditions
  * Design simple algorithms following principles of structured programming
  * Design algorithms that avoid the use of break statements to interrupt loops or to avoid the use of multiple return statements to exit a function
  * Describe and illustrate the operation of searching and sorting algorithms
  * Analyze the running time of simple iterative algorithms
  * Compare the running time of algorithms; determine if one algorithm is more efficient than another

4. Create (design) small to medium size programs using Python:
  * Decompose a solution into parts; decompose a Python program into functions
  * Translate pseudocode to/from Python programs
  * Use the core features of Python to design programs to solve problems: variables, expressions, terminal input and output, type conversion, conditionals, iteration, functions, standard library modules
  * Design programs requiring approximately 100 lines and 6 functions (of well-designed code)
  * Create programs that search or construct lists and strings
  * Create programs that modify lists in-place
  * Refactor repeated statements into for and while loops
  * Describe the benefits of using functions
  * Construct functions such that:
      * have a single purpose (decomposition)
      * are reusable (generalization)
      * include parameters and local variables
      * produce a return value
  * Distinguish "printing inside a function" from "returning a value from a function"
  * Create readable and maintainable programs by applying good programming style:
    * Using descriptive variable and function name
    * Using comments appropriately
    * Using whitespace to clarify the structure of a program
 
5. Use Python's data types (including objects) appropriately:
   * Compare and contrast mutable and immutable data types (lists vs. strings, numeric values)

6. Describe fundamental concepts of time complexity. Identify the order of basic algorithms.

7. Describe the concept of recursion, of recursive definitions and recursive functions.

8. Use recursion to solve problems:
  * Use box tracing to predict the result of simple recursive code (drawing a call stack)
  * Design recursive code following certain basic recursive patterns
  * Design recursive functions that recurse, for example, on lists and strings

Course Policies
======================================================================================
It is the responsibility of every student to read and understand the College Policies. The College Policies on Academic Honesty, Academic Standing, Academic Concession, Final Exam , Grading Practices, Student Conduct, Technology Usage, and more can be found here: [https://corpuschristi.ca/current-students/#Policies](https://corpuschristi.ca/current-students/#Policies)

In addition to the College Policies, this course also upholds the following policies and practices: 
* **Rule #1**: You must **own** your own work. Work that you submit (assignments, labs), you should be able to deeply understand and defend on your own, without needing to consult external material. For instance, at any time, the course instructor should be able to inquire you about your submitted work, and you should be able to give a satisfactory explanation. **The course instructor reserves the right to perform oral interviews or other spot checks to verify the originality of submitted student work.** 
* **Rule #2**: You are encouraged to collaborate together with other students, and use learning resources available to you (textbooks, notes, large language models, asking experts). You must acknowledge all learning resources that you use. 
* **Rule #3**: No collaboration of any kind is permitted during the midterms or during the final exam. 
* **Any violation of the rules listed above will result in a 0 on the work containing misconduct and will be reported, in writing, to the Academic Dean.**
* NB: these policies substantially depart from the UBC Department of Computer Science’s Policy regarding collaboration on academic work, and in particular the CPSC 110 academic integrity policy. It’s highly recommended you be aware of their policies, in case you want to transfer into that Department. 
 
Attendance / Participation:
* As per the college Final Exam policy, students who miss more than 25% of course lectures may be barred from writing the final exam.

Accomodations:
* Students with documented disabilities who may require accommodations must contact the [UBC Centre for Accessibility](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) as soon as possible.

Assignments:
* To satisfy the requirements of this course, students will carry out weekly programming assignments and in-person lab assignments.

Late/Missing Assignments:
* A late assignment will be deducted 10% for every day the assignment is late. For instance, an assignment that is 2 days late and graded out of 100 points will be awarded a maximum of 80 points.
* The lowest assignment and quiz will be dropped.

Extensions:
* As a general rule, extensions will almost never be granted. Instead, the lowest assignment and quiz will be dropped. Extensions on course work will only be granted due to illness or similar **extraordinary** circumstances. In such a case, a note signed by a physician stating the date and time of the visit to the doctor’s office may be required. **Any late work cannot be accepted three weeks after the end of term for any reason.**

Missed Tests:
* Only medical reasons justify make-up exams. In the case of the final exam, as per existing policy, the student must get in touch with the instructor within 48 hours of the missed final.
