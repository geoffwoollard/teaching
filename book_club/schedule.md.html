### What happens at the book club?  
We read one book per month.  Everyone reads in advance as much as they can (you can skip the boring parts). We discuss the book informally, sharing our thoughts, insights, and questions. A facilitator will guide the discussion, and everyone is encouraged to participate in a warm friendly atmosphere.

---

### What type of books?  
There should be some connection to computer science, although it can be somewhat tangential. Books can focus on culturally enriching areas that educate students to be well-rounded computer scientists, such as literature, poetry, popular science, history, biography, philosophy, ethics, spirituality, and professional development. We avoid extremely technical books (e.g., dense textbooks, papers) that would fit better in courses or journal club-style reading groups.  
*Have a look at our past events for many books that suit this book club, many of which are in the [Reading Room collection](https://bibrrs.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/search?searchCode=GKEY^*&limitTo=LOCA=ICICS/CS+Reading+Room).*
