### What happens at the book club?  
We read one book per month.  Everyone reads in advance as much as they can (you can skip the boring parts). We discuss the book informally, sharing our thoughts, insights, and questions. The facilitator will guide the discussion, but everyone is encouraged to participate.

### What type of books?  
There should be some connection to computer science, although it can be somewhat tangential. Books can focus on culturally enriching areas that educate students to be well-rounded computer scientists, such as literature, poetry, popular science, history, biography, philosophy, ethics, spirituality, and professional development. Avoid extremely technical books (e.g., dense textbooks, papers) that would fit better in courses or journal club-style reading groups.  
*Bring your own books, or choose from the [Reading Room collection](https://bibrrs.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/search?searchCode=GKEY^*&limitTo=LOCA=ICICS/CS+Reading+Room).*  
See the running [list of books](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tyL6HbfBnw1QRtlavMUkpmpGethagu4x_-cnkRIl8pY/edit?usp=sharing): and add your own titles. We will decide what books to read via a consensus process.
